A collection of dumped and upscaled textures.

If you want to help out check out this guide on how to dump textures https://youtu.be/UTCYHBLVLLE
Download the texture folder and drag your textures into it, skip overwriting files.
Doing this will help make sure we dont miss any textures.

Alternatively if you have artistic talent consider giving texture work a go and submit it here, whats the worst that could happen?
And finally if you have free time https://dgb.lol/tools play around with this upscaler that is free and allows batch processing of files, I use the balanced preset to upscale the textures.
